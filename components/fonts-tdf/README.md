Library to work with fonts. Primary input format is that produced by "The Dot
Factory" (http://www.eran.io/the-dot-factory-an-lcd-font-and-image-generator).
Library also features a number of smaller bitmapped fonts generated by bdf2c,
with manually added offset tables to be compatible with "The Dot Factory"
output (https://github.com/pixelmatix/bdf2c).
